# ngpo - Angularjs Page Objects - template and page objects

* I want my protractor tests to be as easy to write, easy to read and ignorant of the page elements as possible. 
* I want a simple and consistent protractor page object template
* I want consistent methods across my page objects including: 
	- click
	- getValue
	- enterValue
	- hasClass
* I want a simple and consistent way of accessing repeating page elements. 
	- listElement.getRow(2).someElementInList
* I don't want any code repeated that's needed to create the page objects.
